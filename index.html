During this assignment, I learn how to code using Skeleton Framework. First, I built my resume using skeleton 12-column fluid grid. Next, I made media queries to support the display of different screen sizes. Finally, I link my resume with my home page. In conclusion. I learn a lot from skeleton framework. For example, I learn how to put multiple items inside a container. You can combine images and paragraph with different positions inside a container. You can also abject their placement with rows and column. I like how the CSS had already existing code. This made it easy for me to create. The hard part about this assignment was familiarizing myself with the CSS code.

	what I learned doing this assignment is how simple and efficient. It makes coding very easy especially memberizing the repeated colors, font-sizes, width, and much more. I really enjoy this assignment, I like the symbols, multi-purpose functions, and the large number of variables. However, I don't like whats being replace. This shows that, SASS is only good for simple, repeated function while CSS can hold more with differnt variety.
