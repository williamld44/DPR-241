<p>During this assignment, I learn how to code using Skeleton Framework. First, I built my resume using skeleton 12-column fluid grid. Next, I made media queries to support the display of different screen sizes. Finally, I link my resume with my home page. In conclusion. I learn a lot from skeleton framework. For example, I learn how to put multiple items inside a container. You can combine images and paragraph with different positions inside a container. You can also abject their placement with rows and column. I like how the CSS had already existing code. This made it easy for me to create. The hard part about this assignment was familiarizing myself with the CSS code.</p>

<p>In this assignment, I learn about the Flexbox Framework. The Flexbox Framework showed me how to create a responsive website. During this assignment, I follow steps on how to create responsive webpages like the one shown on my portfolio. Flexbox makes creating website easy, for different-sized devices. I like how easy its’ uses of column and row are. There were not much I didn’t like about Flexbox. Following the steps to create the website was fun and simple, I would definitely use Flexbox for future projects.</p>

			<h4>Bootstrap</h4>

<p>Bootstrap is an excellent framework use to create a responsive website. This shows that, Bootstrap provides responsive web inputs and uses a mobile-first approach. Bootstrap comes with a variety of templates such as buttons, tables, and navigation. Using Bootstrap allows for quick development of web pages. Bootstrap’s media queries made it easy and quick to create a responsive design. What I didn’t like about Bootstrap was familiarizing myself with the pre-install codes, other than that, Bootstrap is the ideal framework to use for beginners.</p>

		<div class="col-2">
<p>what I learned doing this assignment is how simple and efficient it was. It makes coding very easy especially memberizing the repeated colors, font-sizes, width, and much more. I really enjoy this assignment, I like the symbols, multi-purpose functions, and the large number of variables. However, I don't like whats being replace. This shows that, SASS is only good for simple, repeated function while CSS can hold more with differnt variety.</p>

			<p>In this assignment, I was tasked with Researching a Tech Industry that I find most exciting. After exploring many tech industries, I found Seniorlink. I thought about what type of company would impact me with their work. Seniorlink is an in-home care model that provides family caregivers with the confidence and support they need to care for a loved one. This was a touching assignment because my mom is a nurse and she work at a hospital. On the Industry web page, I wrote about Seniorlink and how they help team member feel confident and safe when doing they work. Seniorlink provide tech that improve work and give peace of mind. doing this assignment, I learn a lot about myself. For example, I learn that I want to produce product that help people. I want to use everyday technology to help improved or save lives.</p>
