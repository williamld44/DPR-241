      <p>GitHub allows users to store multiple files on a repository. It also allows others to view and comment on it. This shows that, when using Git, you can change and save files on your local repositories and share with others connect with the origin master allowing them to see your project.<br>
Sharing is not the only thing GitHub can do; you commit changes from your computer to the remote repository via Bitbucket by using the push command. You can also retrieve them by using the pull command. <br>
In my experience with GitHub, I learned that you can do more then push and pull. You can take courses to improve your coding skills. You can also create a project with a group and shared with the world. GitHub allows you to create html web page for free. I also learned how to fork, or make a branch of, a file from a remote repository. GitHub can do many assignments. <br>
During my first assignment I was confused on how to use the command line. This was because, I wasn’t familiar with the command terminal codes. I had a tough time remembering my directory. this would lead to error or files being misplaced. This shows that, in the beginning, I was afraid of using GitHub. I am now more comfortable using the terminal commands to navigate through folders and files and make commits.<br>
  In conclusion, there are many things that I like about using Git and Bitbucket. I like being able to keep track of my files and have a record of the changes that I made on a remote repository. I also like how you can use GitHub to code html web pages. I would recommend GitHub and Bitbucket to beginner and professional. As you use git, you will be able to hone your commenting skills and increase your code efficiency. If I could change one thing about git, it would be making the git desktop app more user friendly. <br></p>
