						<p>A company in the technology industry that most excites me would be Seniorlink. Seniorlink is an in-home care model that provides family caregivers with the confidence and support they need to care for a loved one. They do so by using technology to track daily progress and districting them to managers, nurse, family caregivers, and patients. This shows that, Seniorlink delivery high quality, patient-centered, and stress-free care to family caregivers at a lower cost. This is achieved when the collaboration of everyone combine with technology are integrate and activate on a single and secure platform. By 2000, the mission was set, Seniorlink top priority was to provide for the caregiver nation, honoring caregivers and their families and ensuring they will never be alone on their daily journey of providing compassionate care. One way they ensure their goals are meet would be connecting everyone through technology like Vela. Vela is a transformative technology that connects everyone with a single, centralized, HIPAA-secure collaboration platform.
